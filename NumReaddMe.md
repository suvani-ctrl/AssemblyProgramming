This assembly program defines a simple variable and exits the program with a status code set to the variable's value. The program is written for a 32-bit Linux system and uses system calls to control execution.

Code Overview
The program defines a variable num in the data section with an initial value of 5. In the code section, it sets up a system call to exit, using the value stored in num as the exit code.

Code Breakdown
asm
Copy code
section .data
    num DD 5              ; Define a double word (4 bytes) variable `num` initialized to 5
section .data: This section is used to define and initialize data.
num DD 5: num is a variable stored as a double word (4 bytes) with a value of 5. The DD directive allocates 4 bytes and initializes them to 5.
asm
Copy code
section .text
global _start            ; Declare `_start` as the entry point
section .text: This section contains the code (instructions) for the program.
global _start: Declares _start as the entry point for the program. This is where execution will begin.
asm
Copy code
_start:
    mov eax, 1           ; Load 1 into EAX (system call number for 'exit')
    mov ebx, [num]       ; Load the value at `num` into EBX (exit code)
    int 0x80             ; Trigger interrupt 0x80 to make the system call
_start: Label for the program's starting point.
mov eax, 1: Loads the value 1 into the eax register. In Linux, the syscall number 1 represents exit, meaning the program will exit when this syscall is triggered.
mov ebx, [num]: Loads the value at the memory address of num into ebx. Here, ebx will hold the exit code, which is 5 in this case.
int 0x80: Executes a software interrupt to make the system call. With eax = 1 (exit syscall) and ebx = 5 (exit code), the program will exit and return the code 5.
How to Assemble and Run
Follow these commands to assemble, link, and execute the program:

Assemble the code into an object file:

bash
Copy code
nasm -f elf32 Num.asm -o Num.o
Link the object file to create an executable:

bash
Copy code
ld -m elf_i386 Num.o -o Num
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
./Num
Check the Exit Code: The exit code can be checked using:

bash
Copy code
echo $?
This should output 5, confirming that the program exited with the value of num.

Key Concepts
System Calls: The program uses the Linux int 0x80 interrupt for system calls. mov eax, 1 sets up the exit syscall, and ebx holds the exit code.
Data Access: Square brackets ([num]) indicate that weâ€™re accessing the value at the address of num rather than the literal address itself.
Additional Notes
This code is specific to 32-bit assembly on Linux. To run it on a 64-bit system, you may need to set up a 32-bit compatible environment or adapt the code for 64-bit assembly, as int 0x80 is replaced by syscall in 64-bit assembly.
NASM syntax is used, so it may differ slightly if using a different assemble
